Rubik's Cube Solver

Problem Description
This program is designed to solve a Rubik's Cube by taking an unsolved cube as input and generating the sequence of moves required to solve it.
The solver is expected to handle Rubik's Cubes of any valid configuration, including varying levels of difficulty.

Requirements
The Rubik's Cube solver must meet the following requirements:
1. Versatility: The program should be capable of solving any valid Rubik's Cube configuration.
2. Difficulty Levels: The solver should be able to handle cubes of varying difficulty levels, providing solutions for both simple and complex configurations.

Algorithms
The Rubik's Cube solver employs the following algorithms for optimal cube-solving:
1. Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS): This algorithm systematically explores the solution space by performing depth-first searches with increasing depth limits until a solution is found.
2. A Algorithm*: A* is an algorithm that is used to guide the search, ensuring more efficient exploration of the solution space.

Input
The input for the Rubik's Cube solver is an unsolved Rubik's Cube, represented in a format compatible with the program.

Output
The program generates and outputs a sequence of moves that, when applied to the input Rubik's Cube, will result in a solved configuration.
